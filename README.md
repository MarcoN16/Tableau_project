## Top 10 Station Locations in NY

This analysis focuses on data from the top 10 active bike stations in New York City from March to November 2023. December, January, and February were excluded due to lower ride counts attributed to colder temperatures during these months. The map displays the geographic locations of these stations, with color indicating the average bike usage time and size representing the number of bikes for the period considered. Two main stations stand out: one between W21st & 6th Ave and another between West St & Chamber St.

## Trips Analysis by Customer Type

The first part of the analysis focuses on the total number of trips recorded during different months by customer type: Members and Casual customers. The data reveals a similar trend for both customer types, with April and May showing the highest number of bike rentals across all stations. Next, the analysis examines the average trip duration by user type. Casual customers tend to rent bikes for longer periods compared to members. In August, casual customers exhibit a peak in weekend trip duration, averaging around 27 minutes compared to 20 minutes on weekdays. Members show a smaller difference, with average trip durations of around 14 minutes on weekdays and 12 minutes on weekends.

## Day Type Analysis

The following analysis considers weekdays and weekends to analyze bike usage. April and May see the highest number of rentals during weekdays, while April records the highest number of rentals during weekends. Peak bike rental hours are observed from 8 am to 8 pm on both weekdays and weekends, with high peak at 5 pm during the weekdays. Moreover, a longer average rental times are observed on weekends compared to weekdays.

This part of the analysis focuses on the two most active stations: between W21st & 6th Ave and between West St & Chamber St. The destination plots show that both stations primarily serve the same area, with no substantial difference between weekday and weekend destinations.

## Top 10 Destinations and Bike Types Rented

Finally, the analysis displays the top destination points and their frequency of use. The station at W21st & 6th Ave shows a preference for trips to 9th Ave & W 22nd St (3824 trips) and W 22nd St & 10th Ave (2733 trips). Conversely, the station at West St & Chamber St sees the station itself as the main destination (4788 trips), suggesting many round trips by customers, supported by a longer average rental time observed in the first graph. The classic bike stands out as the predominant type rented during this period, with a noticeable scarcity of electric bikes rented. This trend is consistent across all 10 stations.
